# Data-Wrangling-and-Cleaning

## Data Use:

The data sets considered for obtaining the data are:

1. Threatened Species information
2. Endangered Animals
3. Spatial Data for the animals
4. KMI files for projecting the maps

## Data Preparation:

For performing the wrangling and cleaning the data, data need to be in a format to read the data.
These step by step processes will be detailed in the sections below.

## Data Acquisition:

• Data has been collected from the government website, through the Open Data portal
Data.gov.au, all the endangered animal’s information has been collected from the portal.

• Data has also been collected from state open data portals, states like Queensland, ACT, and
Victoria.

• Spatial Data information has also collected for all the animals across the country from the
Environmental website.

# Data Cleaning:

• Since the Obtained data contains multiple columns that will not be used in the project,
unnecessary columns have been removed from the data and the final datasets for
wrangling have been performed.

• Data cleaning like removing the duplicate rows and null values from the data sets and
obtained the final desired columns.

## Data Wrangling:

• Data Wrangling has been performed on the different datasets, in order to merge the cleaned
datasets with the geo positions, such that each species will be noted with its geo presence
across the country.

• Wrangling techniques have been performed to obtain the data open database (SPART), to
obtain the animal habitat, threats, description.

• The wrangling has been done to obtain the open source images for each species from the
Wikipedia site, such that those can be embedded into the website.

• Data was made in order to satisfy the 3NF to fit the Relational Database. Such that there
won't be any duplicates and many to many relationships across the tables.
